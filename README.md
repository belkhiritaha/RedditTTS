# RedditTTS


this bot uses the praw reddit api wrapper to query the hottest posts on your subreddit of choice.
then it uses html templates to simulate the post, and the comments of the thread.
it then uses the gTTS library to get a mp3 file of the post/comments and some movipy magic to stick everything together
